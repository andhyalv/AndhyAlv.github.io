Using a dataset from the Massachusetts Education Department, I created KPI visualizations in Tableau to get a clear picture of how their education system is performing.


### 1. Introduction / Why
A strong education is an important foundation for kids as they grow up. I believe it is important to understand why schools perform the way they do, and to take the lessons from that to improve overall performance. Through analyzing the Massachusetts DOE dataset, I believe that we will we learn insights about the low and high performing schools. These insights will allow key stakeholders to make informed decisions on how to improve performance in the education system. 

### 2. What will you learn
a) The graduation rate among schools is split by many high performing schools, with several other low performing schools.
b) Schools with high college attendance rate have a class size around 10-20 students, and economically disadvantaged schools tend to have much lower college attendance rates.
c) Many schools are behind the passing threshold for the 4th grade standardized math test. 

### 3. Dataset and tools
The dataset is provided by the Massachusetts Department of Education. It contains performance metrics from 1,861 schools and 953,748 students. I input this data into Tableau to create visualizations for the relationships that we are investigating.
